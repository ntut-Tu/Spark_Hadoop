# Setup Step
1. install docker
2. run (docker)setup.bat
    > Make sure no errors occur during the setup process. In some environments (especially win11), permission issues may arise; in such cases, you may need to install using the image directly instead. 
3. run (win)init_environment.bat
4. run (win)run_spark.bat
5. run (win)start_spark_stream.bat
6. run (win)run_cli_predict.bat
